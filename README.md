## Description

This project represents a simple website showcasing my favorite action movies. It was built using HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript. The project might be useful to showcase the power of the JavaScript. It makes use of the Event Listeners and DOM methods to make the website interactive. In particular, in this project we implemented the following JavaScript features:

* The menu is created dynamically based on the amount of content sections are added. No need to manually update the menu everytime you add content.
* As you scroll through sections, active menu link and the content section are highlighted.
* When you click on the menu link, it scrolls smoothly to the correct section.
* Fixed navigation bar is hidden when the user no longer scrolls and it appears back once you start scrolling again.
* Scroll to top button is added to the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold.
* Sections are collapsible if you click on the movie title.
